Its popularity has often been considered concerning and authorities have tried to convince people that there’s no such restriction. Some were also interested in understanding what could have caused this belief to exist. It is said that this myth could have come from the idea that everyone who dies in the Royal Palace is eligible for a state funeral. However, entering the Parliament Houses in London wearing armour suits are prohibited and this is not a myth.`,
        `A statue displaying two mice eating a piece of cheese is known as the smallest statue in the world. It is that small that you have to pay attention or someone must point you to it.

Both of them died and later it was understood that mice had actually eaten their meal.`,

        `Boston constructed the first public park, Boston Common in 1634; the first public school, Boston Latin, in 1635; and the first subway system in the nation, known as the Tremont Street Subway, in 1897. Then there's the first inoculation, telephone, and industrial arts school (not to brag). Newer firsts include the Big Dig, which set a precedent for smart urban planning around the globe, and of course there's the first social media network (Facebook) too.`,
        `With all those firsts, it's easy to understand that Boston ranked fifth in the world for innovation in 2017. Some of the "innovation friendly" factors include cultural assets, education centers, transportation, and biking or walking accessibility. Of course, the city's world-renowned research institutions like MIT, Harvard, and Tufts add to this cutting-edge clout, as do the thousands of digital startups and entrepreneurs that have set up operations here.`,

While there's walking, biking, running, and host of other exercise options here, the American Fitness Index named the city in its top ten fittest U.S. cities citing "more public parks, playgrounds, and farmers markets per capita than [their] target goal for a healthy city." This, combined with convenient access to some of the best teaching hospitals in the country, makes Boston a healthy, happy, and wise city to call home.`,

        `There are countless things to do in Boston but any time spent here must include a sampling of the city's art, music, and theatre.
              Boston is a city deeply committed to supporting the arts. With world-renowned institutions like the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, The Boston Symphony Orchestra, Berklee School of Music, and Huntington Theatre Company all calling Boston their home, it's no surprise that in 2017, the NCAR Arts Vibrancy Index listed Boston as #6 on their Top 20 Arts Vibrant Cities.

Many of them are immigrants, and the diversity they bring to the city foments a friendly atmosphere that is welcoming to all.`,
        `Madrid's climate is continental. Temperatures are high in summer and low in winter, but rarely reach extreme levels. The warmest months typically record up to 33ºC (91ºF), and temperatures can fall as low as 7ºC (45ºF) in the coldest months. The city enjoys more cloudless days per year than any other capital in Europe.`,
        `Madrid offers students virtually inexhaustible possibilities for entertainment and cultural enrichment. Art fans have the renowned Prado Museum and other world-class galleries at their disposal. Lovers of music enjoy enjoy a constant offering of concerts, whether their passion be in Opera, Rock, Jazz, or Rap. Bustling downtown avenues like the Gran Via display an endless of procession of cinemas, live theaters, trendy shops, and open markets.`,

A more affordable option is the Abono de Transporte, which is a monthly pass to the bus, metro, and train systems (organized by zones) that can be purchased at any tobacco or magazine stand throughout the city.`,
        `Most Spanish people actually don’t mind if you don’t eat meat… but ham? That’s pretty serious in Madrid, as Iberian ham is a huge source of pride for the city and its locals. If you really are a strict vegetarian, make sure to ask waiters if dishes you order have ham. Often, bits of ham are added on to veggie or pasta dishes, but it’s not mentioned on the menu.`,
        `Madrid’s cardinal sin is telling a Spanish grandmother you’re full. If you’re eating in someone’s home and you tell the host you’re full, it will not only offend them, but you’ll still be served much more. It’s better to say something like “un poco más,” which means just a little bit more. This way, you’ll be served just a small portion more and won’t offend your host.`,
        `Ah, the dreaded false cognate. Cognates are words that sound the same in two different languages and have the same meaning. A false cognate, however, means that words in different languages sound the same but have a very different meaning. So be careful when speaking Spanish that you think you know but don’t, because if you say “embarazada” it actually means you’re pregnant, not embarrassed.`,
